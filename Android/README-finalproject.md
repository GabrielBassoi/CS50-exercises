Hello world, my final project is called Sevnote, it is a notepad that you can create as many notes as you want, 
about its functions: a search bar that filters the notes both by name and text, you be switch between lightmode 
and darkmode and the app save which you selected, a tab with your favorite notes and also add a note in the bottom 
right corner. Within the note you can set it as a favorite, edit the name and text, save the note's contents in a .txt 
file, to return to the main menu, you can use either the arrow or the back button on the cell phone itself, and 
delete the note in the lower right corner. The design: I made this application in my view of what is currently modern 
for applications and with a slightly minimalist design. To create it I used Adobe XD to assemble the layout, Android 
Studio and my willpower. Thank you very much.
